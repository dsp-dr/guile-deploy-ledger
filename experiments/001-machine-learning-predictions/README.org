#+TITLE: Experiment 001: Machine Learning for Deployment Predictions
#+DATE: 2024-01-15
#+AUTHOR: DSP-DR

* Hypothesis
We can use historical deployment data to predict:
- Deployment failure likelihood
- Optimal deployment windows
- Service interdependency impacts
- Resource requirements

* Approach

** Data Collection Phase
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle collect-data.scm
(use-modules (deploy-ledger storage sqlite)
             (deploy-ledger query metrics)
             (ice-9 format))

(define (extract-features db service-name)
  "Extract ML features from deployment history"
  (let* ((deployments (list-deployments db #:service-name service-name))
         (patterns (deployment-patterns db)))
    `((service . ,service-name)
      (total-deployments . ,(length deployments))
      (hourly-distribution . ,(assoc-ref patterns 'hourly-distribution))
      (weekly-distribution . ,(assoc-ref patterns 'weekly-distribution))
      (failure-patterns . ,(find-failure-patterns db)))))

(define (export-training-data db output-file)
  "Export deployment data for ML training"
  (with-output-to-file output-file
    (lambda ()
      (let ((services (list-services db)))
        (for-each
         (lambda (svc)
           (let ((features (extract-features db (service-metadata-name svc))))
             (write features)
             (newline)))
         services)))))

** Feature Engineering
Key features to extract:
1. Time-based features
   - Hour of day
   - Day of week
   - Days since last deployment
   - Deployment velocity trend

2. Service features
   - Service type (monolith/microservice)
   - Number of dependencies
   - Historical success rate
   - Average deployment duration

3. Environmental features
   - Target environment
   - Deployment type
   - Concurrent deployments

** Model Architecture
Consider multiple approaches:
- Random Forest for failure prediction
- LSTM for time-series deployment forecasting
- Graph Neural Networks for dependency impact

** Integration Plan
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle ml-predictor.scm
(define-module (deploy-ledger plugins ml-predictor)
  #:use-module (deploy-ledger core types)
  #:export (predict-deployment-outcome
            suggest-deployment-time
            analyze-risk))

(define (predict-deployment-outcome deployment)
  "Predict success probability for a deployment"
  ;; Call Python ML model via FFI or subprocess
  (let ((features (extract-deployment-features deployment)))
    (call-ml-model "predict_outcome" features)))

(define (suggest-deployment-time service-name)
  "Suggest optimal deployment window"
  ;; Analyze historical patterns
  (let ((patterns (get-deployment-patterns service-name)))
    (find-optimal-window patterns)))

(define (analyze-risk deployment dependencies)
  "Analyze risk based on dependency graph"
  ;; Use graph algorithms to assess impact
  (calculate-risk-score deployment dependencies))
