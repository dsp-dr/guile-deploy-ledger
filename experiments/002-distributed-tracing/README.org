#+TITLE: Experiment 002: Distributed Tracing Integration
#+DATE: 2024-01-15
#+AUTHOR: DSP-DR

* Objective
Integrate deployment events with distributed tracing systems (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) to correlate deployments with performance impacts.

* Hypothesis
By correlating deployment events with distributed traces, we can:
- Identify performance regressions immediately after deployment
- Track deployment propagation across microservices
- Measure real-world deployment impact on user transactions

* Architecture Design

** Trace Context Propagation
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle trace-context.scm
(define-module (deploy-ledger integrations tracing)
  #:use-module (deploy-ledger core types)
  #:export (create-deployment-span
            inject-trace-context
            correlate-with-traces))

(define (create-deployment-span deployment)
  "Create OpenTelemetry span for deployment"
  `((trace-id . ,(generate-trace-id))
    (span-id . ,(generate-span-id))
    (operation . "deployment")
    (service . ,(deployment-event-service-name deployment))
    (version . ,(deployment-event-version deployment))
    (attributes . ((deployment.type . ,(deployment-event-deployment-type deployment))
                   (deployment.environment . ,(deployment-event-environment deployment))
                   (deployment.status . ,(deployment-event-status deployment))))))

(define (inject-trace-context deployment headers)
  "Inject trace context into deployment webhooks"
  (let ((span (create-deployment-span deployment)))
    (assoc-set! headers "traceparent"
                (format #f "00-~a-~a-01"
                       (assoc-ref span 'trace-id)
                       (assoc-ref span 'span-id)))))

** Metrics Collection
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle metrics-collector.scm
(define (collect-deployment-metrics deployment traces)
  "Collect performance metrics from traces during deployment"
  (let ((start-time (deployment-event-started deployment))
        (end-time (or (deployment-event-completed deployment)
                     (current-time))))
    (filter-map
     (lambda (trace)
       (if (trace-in-window? trace start-time end-time)
           `((latency . ,(trace-latency trace))
             (error-rate . ,(trace-error-rate trace))
             (throughput . ,(trace-throughput trace)))
           #f))
     traces)))
#+END_SRC

* Implementation Plan

** Phase 1: OpenTelemetry Integration
1. [ ] Add OTLP exporter support
2. [ ] Create deployment spans
3. [ ] Link deployment events to traces

** Phase 2: Correlation Engine
1. [ ] Query traces during deployment window
2. [ ] Calculate performance deltas
3. [ ] Generate impact reports

** Phase 3: Real-time Monitoring
1. [ ] Stream deployment events to tracing backend
2. [ ] Set up alerts for performance degradation
3. [ ] Auto-rollback triggers based on traces

* Test Scenarios

** Scenario 1: Canary Deployment Tracking
Track how a canary deployment affects different percentiles of request latency.

** Scenario 2: Service Mesh Integration
Correlate deployment events with Istio/Linkerd metrics.

** Scenario 3: Multi-region Deployment
Track deployment propagation across regions using distributed traces.
