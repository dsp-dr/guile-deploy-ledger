#+TITLE: Experiment 003: Chaos Engineering Integration
#+DATE: 2024-01-15
#+AUTHOR: DSP-DR

* Goal
Integrate deployment tracking with chaos engineering experiments to validate deployment resilience.

* Concept
Track chaos experiments as special deployment events to:
- Correlate failures with chaos experiments
- Measure recovery time from induced failures
- Validate deployment rollback mechanisms
- Test dependency failure scenarios

* Implementation

** Chaos Event Tracking
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle chaos-events.scm
(define-module (deploy-ledger plugins chaos)
  #:use-module (deploy-ledger core types)
  #:export (record-chaos-experiment
            analyze-chaos-impact
            chaos-deployment-correlation))

(define (record-chaos-experiment experiment)
  "Record chaos experiment as special deployment"
  (make-deployment-event
   #:service-name (assoc-ref experiment 'target-service)
   #:version "chaos-experiment"
   #:environment (assoc-ref experiment 'environment)
   #:deployment-type 'chaos-engineering
   #:metadata `((experiment-type . ,(assoc-ref experiment 'type))
                (blast-radius . ,(assoc-ref experiment 'blast-radius))
                (hypothesis . ,(assoc-ref experiment 'hypothesis)))))

(define (analyze-chaos-impact experiment deployments)
  "Analyze impact of chaos experiment on deployments"
  (let ((during-chaos (filter-deployments-during experiment deployments))
        (after-chaos (filter-deployments-after experiment deployments)))
    `((failures-during . ,(count-failures during-chaos))
      (recovery-time . ,(calculate-recovery-time experiment after-chaos))
      (rollbacks-triggered . ,(count-rollbacks after-chaos)))))

** Experiment Scenarios

*** Network Partition
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle experiments/network-partition.yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: NetworkChaos
metadata:
  name: network-partition-test
spec:
  action: partition
  mode: all
  selector:
    namespaces:
      - production
  direction: both
  target:
    selector:
      namespaces:
        - production
  duration: "5m"
#+END_SRC

*** Pod Failure
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle experiments/pod-failure.yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: pod-failure-test
spec:
  action: pod-kill
  mode: random-max-percent
  value: "50"
  selector:
    labelSelectors:
      app: payment-service
  duration: "10m"

* Metrics to Track

** Resilience Metrics
- Time to detect failure
- Time to recover (automated)
- Manual intervention required
- Cascading failure count

** Deployment Impact
- Deployments failed during chaos
- Deployments succeeded despite chaos
- Rollbacks triggered
- SLA violations

* Integration Points

1. **Chaos Mesh**: Kubernetes chaos engineering
2. **Litmus**: Cloud-native chaos engineering
3. **Gremlin**: Failure-as-a-service platform
4. **AWS FIS**: Fault injection simulator

* Experiment Log

** [2024-01-15] Database Failure Simulation
- Target: PostgreSQL primary
- Duration: 5 minutes
- Result: Automatic failover successful
- Recovery time: 45 seconds

** [2024-01-16] API Gateway Latency Injection
- Target: API Gateway
- Latency: +500ms
- Duration: 15 minutes
- Result: Circuit breaker triggered correctly

* Automation

** Scheduled Chaos
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle scheduled-chaos.scm
(define (schedule-chaos-experiments db)
  "Schedule regular chaos experiments"
  (let ((experiments '((monday . network-latency)
                      (wednesday . pod-failure)
                      (friday . database-failover))))
    (for-each
     (lambda (exp)
       (when (eq? (current-day) (car exp))
         (run-chaos-experiment (cdr exp))
         (record-chaos-event db (cdr exp))))
     experiments)))
